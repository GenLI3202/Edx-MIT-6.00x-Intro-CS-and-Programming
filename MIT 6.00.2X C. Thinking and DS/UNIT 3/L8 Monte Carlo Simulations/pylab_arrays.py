#This code shows the very basics of creating arrays and using them

import pylab

#Array of ints
a = pylab.array([1,4,5,8])
print(a)
print (type(a))

#Array of floats
b = pylab.array([2,3,7,9], float)
print(b)

#Can do math on the arrays very easily, which we couldn't do with lists
c = a * 2 + 10
print (c)

d = a * b
print (d)

#Can even do element-wise operations like sine:
print (pylab.sin(d))

#Like lists, arrays can be sliced and mutated
print (d[1:])

d[0] = 1000
print (d)

#Add elements to an array using the append function
d = pylab.append(d,[1,2,3])
print (d)

#It is more efficient to create arrays of a large size at once rather than
#increasing its length in steps. To create a matrix of zeros or ones:
e = pylab.zeros((2,3))
f = pylab.ones((2,3))
print('\n', e, '\n', f)
#To change the element of f at row 2 and column 1 to 5 we would write:
f[1,0] = 5;
# 1 - row 2;  0 - column 1
print (f)

#To change the whole second row to 10, we could write:
f[1,:] = 10
print (f)


#Other useful functions are arange and linspace. arange returns an array
#with regularly incremented values. linspace returns an array with a
#specified number of elements between beginning and end values

print (pylab.arange(2, 3, 0.1))
print (pylab.linspace(1.0, 4.0, 6))
