# MIT 6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming

This repository contains my coursework and solutions for MIT's 6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming courses, completed through edX from year 2021 to 2022. 

## About the Courses

### MIT 6.00.1x - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python
A comprehensive introduction to computer science as a tool for solving real analytical problems using Python 3.5.

**Topics Covered:**
- Basic Python programming (variables, expressions, statements)
- Control flow (conditionals, loops)
- Data structures (strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- Functions and scope
- Object-oriented programming
- Testing and debugging
- Algorithmic thinking
- Problem solving strategies

### MIT 6.00.2x - Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science
Building upon 6.00.1x, this course focuses on using computation to understand real-world phenomena.

**Topics Covered:**
- Optimization and knapsack problems
- Decision trees and dynamic programming
- Graph problems
- Stochastic thinking and random walks
- Statistical analysis and plotting
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Experimental data analysis
